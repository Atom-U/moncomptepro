# Run cypress locally

You can use `./scripts/run-test.sh` to run tests locally. Run it to get usage help.

The script will error out if it doesnâ€™t find the necessary env vars. Ask a teammate for specific env vars and put the values in your `.env`.

:information_source: By default, the script runs the test node server on port 3002. This is done so that you can keep your default local dev instance up while running the tests.
